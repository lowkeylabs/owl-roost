# OWL-ROOST (Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool)

**ROOST** (Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool) provides tools for the exploration and study of retirement questions.

ROOST encapsulates four key concepts:
* Options — A focused retirement question that organizes the exploration of alternative strategies in order to understand trade-offs and risks.  *Examples: Roth conversion options, early retirement options, spending guardrail options, asset class mix options.*
* Choices — Distinct courses of action within an options set, each representing a different way to address the underlying retirement question. *Examples: no Roth conversions, partial annual conversions, aggressive bracket-filling conversions; retire at 62 vs 65 vs 67; fixed real spending vs guardrail spending.*
* Cases — Fully specified OWL cases that define the assumptions and inputs for a particular choice, independent of any computed outcomes. *Examples:* a baseline OWL case with no overrides, a case with modified tax assumptions, a case with altered asset allocation or contribution rules.
* Results — The artifacts produced by running OWL on a case, used to evaluate outcomes, uncertainty, and trade-offs across choices. *Examples: all the numbers in the current run synopsis, projected balance trajectories, lifetime tax paid, probability of shortfall, percentile outcomes, charts and summary tables.*

In summary: **Options** define the questions; **Choices** define the alternatives; **Cases** define the assumptions; **Results** define the evidence
