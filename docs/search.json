    "text": "What OWL Does\nOWL is a modeling framework for exploring retirement financial decisions under uncertainty. It uses rigorous mathematical optimization to compute optimal strategies under a given set of assumptions.\nOWL:\n\nOptimizes a single case\nUses linear programming\nSolves for either:\n\nmaximum sustainable spending, or\nmaximum after-tax bequest\n\nApplies detailed constraints involving:\n\ntaxes\nRoth conversions\nSocial Security\nMedicare and IRMAA\n\nRe-optimizes under each run rather than simulating fixed behavior\n\nOWL is a laboratory instrument, not a prescriptive planner."

    "text": "What ROOST Adds\nRetirement decisions cannot be planned with certainty. Markets are volatile, tax rules change, and life rarely follows a single path.\nWhat can be done is to understand:\n\nhow sensitive outcomes are to assumptions,\nhow different strategies trade risk for reward, and\nwhich choices feel robust across uncertainty.\n\nROOST exists to support that understanding.\nROOST provides structure for:\n\norganizing retirement questions,\ndefining meaningful alternatives,\nexecuting consistent OWL runs, and\ncomparing results across choices."
