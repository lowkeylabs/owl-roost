**ROOST** (Retirement Options and Outcomes Studies Tool) provides tools for the exploration and study of retirement questions.

ROOST encapsulates four key concepts:

* Options — A focused retirement question that organizes the exploration of alternative strategies in order to understand trade-offs and risks.  *Examples: Roth conversion options, early retirement options, spending guardrail options, asset class mix options.*

* Choices — Distinct courses of action within an options set, each representing a different way to address the underlying retirement question. *Examples: no Roth conversions, partial annual conversions, aggressive bracket-filling conversions; retire at 62 vs 65 vs 67; fixed real spending vs guardrail spending.*

* Cases — Fully specified OWL cases that define the assumptions and inputs for a particular choice, independent of any computed outcomes. *Examples:* a baseline OWL case with no overrides, a case with modified tax assumptions, a case with altered asset allocation or contribution rules.

* Results — The artifacts produced by running OWL on a case, used to evaluate outcomes, uncertainty, and trade-offs across choices. *Examples: all the numbers in the current run synopsis, projected balance trajectories, lifetime tax paid, probability of shortfall, percentile outcomes, charts and summary tables.*

In summary: **Options** define the questions; **Choices** define the alternatives; **Cases** define the assumptions; **Results** define the evidence

# ROOST and OWL: Complementary Tools

**ROOST does not replace OWL.**
ROOST **builds on OWL** by organizing and comparing OWL results in ways that help people understand choices, trade-offs, and risk.

OWL is the optimization engine.
ROOST is the decision-support environment.

Together, they form a rigorous framework for exploring retirement questions under uncertainty.

## How OWL and ROOST Differ

| Tool                                | Purpose                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OWL (Optimal Wealth Laboratory)** | Optimizes a *single* retirement case under a specified set of assumptions     |
| **ROOST**                           | Organizes and compares *multiple* OWL cases to explore options and trade-offs |

Put simply:

> **OWL computes optimal outcomes.**
> **ROOST helps you understand your options.**

## What OWL Does

[OWL](https://github.com/mdlacasse/Owl) is a modeling framework for exploring retirement financial decisions under uncertainty.
It uses rigorous mathematical optimization to compute optimal strategies under a given set of assumptions.

OWL:

* Optimizes a **single case**
* Uses **linear programming**
* Solves for either:

  * maximum sustainable spending, or
  * maximum after-tax bequest
* Applies detailed constraints involving:

  * taxes
  * Roth conversions
  * Social Security
  * Medicare and IRMAA
* Re-optimizes under each run rather than simulating fixed behavior

OWL is a **laboratory instrument**, not a prescriptive planner.

## What ROOST Adds

Retirement decisions cannot be planned with certainty.
Markets are volatile, tax rules change, and life rarely follows a single path.

What *can* be done is to understand:

* how sensitive outcomes are to assumptions,
* how different strategies trade risk for reward, and
* which choices feel robust across uncertainty.

**ROOST exists to support that understanding.**

ROOST provides structure for:

* organizing retirement questions,
* defining meaningful alternatives,
* executing consistent OWL runs, and
* comparing results across choices.

## Core Concepts in ROOST

ROOST is built around four core concepts:

### **Options**

A focused retirement question that organizes the exploration of alternative strategies in order to understand trade-offs and risks.

*Examples:*

* Roth conversion options
* Early retirement options
* Spending guardrail options
* Asset class mix options

### **Choices**

Distinct courses of action within an options set, each representing a different way to address the underlying retirement question.

*Examples:*

* No Roth conversions vs partial vs aggressive conversions
* Retire at 62 vs 65 vs 67
* Fixed real spending vs guardrail spending

---

### **Cases**

Fully specified OWL cases that define the assumptions and inputs for a particular choice, independent of any computed outcomes.

*Examples:*

* A baseline OWL case with no overrides
* A case with modified tax assumptions
* A case with altered asset allocation or contribution rules

### **Results**

The artifacts produced by running OWL on a case, used to evaluate outcomes, uncertainty, and trade-offs across choices.

*Examples:*

* Run synopses and summary tables
* Projected balance trajectories
* Lifetime taxes paid
* Probability of shortfall or ruin
* Percentile outcomes and charts

### Conceptual Summary

> **Options define the questions.**
> **Choices define the alternatives.**
> **Cases define the assumptions.**
> **Results define the evidence.**

ROOST does **not** decide for you — it helps you understand.

## A Clear Boundary

ROOST intentionally excludes:

* retirement planning logic
* financial rules
* tax calculations
* optimization formulations

Those remain **authoritative inside OWL**.

ROOST focuses exclusively on:

* how assumptions vary across choices,
* which cases are compared,
* how uncertainty is explored, and
* what can be learned from comparing results.

## Typical Workflow

1. Identify a retirement question and define an **options** set
2. Define one or more **choices** that represent meaningful alternatives
3. Specify **cases** for each choice using OWL inputs and overrides
4. Run OWL to generate **results**
5. Compare results across choices to understand trade-offs and risk

Insights may inform:

* personal decision-making, or
* future refinement of OWL models and assumptions

## Feedback Loop to OWL

ROOST is not a one-way consumer of OWL.

Insights gained while comparing options may motivate:

* improved formulations,
* new constraints,
* better objective handling,
* enhanced rate modeling, or
* performance optimizations in OWL itself.

OWL remains the authoritative solver.
ROOST serves as a structured environment for learning from its results.

## Relationship to Interactive Tools

* [`owlplanner.streamlit.app`](https://owlplanner.streamlit.app/) provides interactive exploration of individual OWL cases and limited multi-case comparison.
* **ROOST** emphasizes **reproducible, scriptable, and research-oriented** comparison of choices across multiple OWL runs.

These tools are complementary, not competing.

## Summary

* **OWL** is the optimizer.
* **ROOST** organizes options, choices, cases, and results.
* Together, they support thoughtful retirement planning under uncertainty — without pretending there is a single “right” answer.
